The Problem: I needed to identify vulnerabilities in a target Linux server
The Action: I used Nmao to perform a full port scan and version detection
The Discovery: I found that the server was running vsftpd 2.3.4, which is a known vulnerable service.
The Recommendation: I recommend updating the FTP service or cloding the port if not in use.
